# psyphr

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The `psyphr` R package tranforms [psychophysiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysiology) data from 
proprietary data collection and processing systems into a [tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) form for downstream analysis 
and visualization.

The package is currently under active development. Currently, only [Electrodermal Activity](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/eda/3-2/) and [Heart Rate Variability](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/hrv/3-2/) output data from [MindWare Technologies](https://www.mindwaretech.com/) are supported. 


## TODO

The development team considers the following for the package's future:

- Submit `psyphr` to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) for peer review and publication
- Customizable data QA utilities with meaningful defaults
- Common, publication-grade visualization schemes
- Study compilation utility
- Compatibility on data feeds from other popular data collection and processing systems (e.g., [BIOPAC](https://www.biopac.com/))
