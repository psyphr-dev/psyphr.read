<!-- badges: end -->

The `psyphr` R package tranforms
[psychophysiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysiology)
data from commercial data collection and processing systems into a
[tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) form for downstream
analysis and visualization.

### WIP

The package is currently under active development.

Currently, the package supports data outputs from the the following
corresponding [MindWare Technologies](https://www.mindwaretech.com/)
applications in version 3.2:

  - [Electrodermal Activity
    (EDA)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/eda/3-2/)
  - [Heart Rate Variability
    (HRV)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/hrv/3-2/)
  - [Electromyography
    (EMG)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/emg/3-2/)
  - [Blood Pressure Variability
    (BPV)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/bpv/3-2/)
  - [Impedance Cardiography
    (IMP)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/imp/3-2/)
  - [Basic Signal Analysis
    (BSA)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/bsa/3-2/)

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wendtke/psyphr")
```

## Usage

``` r
require(psyphr)
```

### Read a Single File

### Compile a Study

#### Directory Structure

### Exploratory Analysis

## TODO

The development team considers the following for the packageâ€™s future:

  - Submit `psyphr` to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) for peer review
    and publication
  - Customizable data QA utilities with meaningful defaults
  - Common, publication-grade visualization schemes
  - Study compilation utility
  - Compatibility on data feeds from other popular data collection and
    processing systems (e.g., [BIOPAC](https://www.biopac.com/))
