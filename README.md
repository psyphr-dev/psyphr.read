`psyphr` is an analytical suite for
[psychophysiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysiology)
data generated by commercial data collection and processing systems.

The package turns the output from the systems into
[tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) form, and facilitates
common exploratory analysis and visualization schemes.

### Work-in-Progress

The package is under active development.

Currently, the package supports the following [MindWare
Technologies](https://www.mindwaretech.com/) applications:

  - [Electrodermal Activity
    (EDA)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/eda/3-2/)

  - [Heart Rate Variability
    (HRV)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/hrv/3-2/)

  - [Electromyography
    (EMG)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/emg/3-2/)

  - [Blood Pressure Variability
    (BPV)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/bpv/3-2/)

  - [Impedance Cardiography
    (IMP)](https://support.mindwaretech.com/manuals/software/imp/3-2/)

    [Basic Signal Analysis

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wendtke/psyphr")
```

## TODO

The development team considers the following for the package’s future:

  - Submit `psyphr` to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) for peer review
    and publication
  - Customizable data QA utilities with meaningful defaults
  - Common, publication-grade visualization schemes
  - Study compilation utility
  - Compatibility on data feeds from other popular data collection and
    processing systems (e.g., [BIOPAC](https://www.biopac.com/))

## Acknowledgements

`psyphr` was founded at the [Uncoast
Unconf 2019](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/uu-2019) with the help of
[Amanda Gadrow](https://github.com/ajmcoqui) and [Audrey
McCombs](https://github.com/almccombs). Travel to the Uncoast Unconf was
supported by Colorado State University (Department of Human Development
and Family Studies and The Graduate School) and the Uncoast Unconf
organizing committee, particularly [Dr. Sam
